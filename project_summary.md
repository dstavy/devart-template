## Description
Installation and an app that stores fingerprints from people around the world. Scale them and rotate them so that they take same space and area on the screen. The projection on the screen changes from one fingerprint to another in a past that looks like animation or pealing an onion.
The user can also zoom in up to a state where the fingerprints turn into blocks of black and white pixels. The work talks about privacy, and uniqueness, me and the others. One aspect of technology is that it separates us from one another. Find our uniqueness. It makes us want to show our special us. But also use it to analyse and track us. The other aspect of technology that is somehow contradictory is that it connects us. Letting us unite without fear or effort. Many of my works deal with this ambiguity. The fingerprint are unique but when unite together can make a piece of art which is fluid and stateless, and when looking closely they even lose any meaning at all. 
Insert a description containing about 100 to 150 words, including your motivation and the meaning behind your idea and execution. The Judges will be keen to know how your idea pushes the boundaries of code and technology.
